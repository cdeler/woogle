	"content": "Gun laws in Australia are mainly the jurisdiction of Australian states and territories, with the importation of guns regulated by the federal government. In the last two decades of the 20th century, following several high-profile killing sprees, the federal government coordinated more restrictive firearms legislation with all state governments. Gun laws were largely aligned in 1996 by the National Firearms Agreement.\nA person must have a firearm licence to possess or use a firearm. Licence holders must demonstrate a \"genuine reason\" (which does not include self-defence) for holding a firearm licence and must not be a \"prohibited person\". All firearms must be registered by serial number to the owner, who also holds a firearms licence. \nStudies on the effects of Australia's gun laws have argued that the laws have been effective in reducing mass shootings, gun suicides and armed crime, while other studies have argued that the laws have had little effect. Polling shows strong support for gun legislation in Australia with around 85-90% of people wanting the same or greater level of restrictions.",
