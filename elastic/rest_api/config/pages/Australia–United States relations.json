At the governmental level, Australia\u2013United States relations are formalised by the ANZUS treaty and the Australia\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement.\nAccording to a 2014 BBC World Service poll, 44 percent of Australians had a \"mainly positive\" view of the United States and 46 percent had a \"mainly negative\" view, for a net rating of \u22122 points. No similar survey was conducted to ascertain American perceptions of Australia. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 55% of Australians approve of U.S. leadership, with 21% disapproving and 24% uncertain. In a more recent 2016 Pew Research poll, 60% of Australians approve of U.S. leadership. In 2017, a major poll conducted in Australia by the Lowy Institute showed that 77% believed an alliance with the US was important for security. However, the survey showed that 60% of Australians had developed an unfavorable view of the US as a result of President Donald Trump. The survey also showed that the US was no longer considered Australia's \"best friend\", a title now held by New Zealand. A 2017 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed only 29% of Australians had confidence in current US leader President Donald Trump, in contrast to the 87% who had confidence in former US president, Barack Obama. It also showed 70% of Australians had no confidence in the current US president. The annual Lowy Institute survey revealed that in 2018 only 55% of Australians believed that the US could act responsibly in the world. This was a drop from 83% in 2011 and a record low. The survey also revealed that 70% of Australians don't think that Donald Trump could act responsibly with only 30% believing he could do so."}
